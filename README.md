# artsyAI
My first Project!! This repository holds a basic AI made with tensorflow that can tell apart a livingroom from a bedroom, as well as differentiate when one of these is full of people or it's empty. To use this tool you can:
1. Upload an image or open up the camera of your device 
2. Make sure you include as much of the room and of what's in it as possible
3. The ai will tell you if it's a living room or bedroom with or without people.
